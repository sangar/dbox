# libmc

A small foundation library for C: arenas, length-carrying strings, one error model, containers, text utilities, JSON and YAML, structured logging and a portable platform layer. It builds to a single static library, `libmc.a`, with a plain C ABI, so it can be linked from C, C++ and any language with a C foreign function interface.

## Features

- **Arena allocation.** Allocations are freed together, and scratch work is undone with mark and release.
- **Strings as views.** A `String` is a pointer and a length, and every function that allocates one takes an `Arena`.
- **One error model.** Fallible functions return an `Error` code and can fill in an optional message.
- **Nothing to install** beyond libc, libm and pthreads, and no global state for the caller to manage. Its libraries, [yyjson](https://github.com/ibireme/yyjson) for JSON, [cyaml](https://github.com/andrewmd5/cyaml) for YAML, [utf8proc](https://github.com/JuliaStrings/utf8proc) for Unicode, [md4c](https://github.com/mity/md4c) for Markdown, [Expat](https://libexpat.github.io) for XML and [curl](https://curl.se) on [mbedTLS](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls), [nghttp2](https://nghttp2.org) and [zlib](https://zlib.net) for HTTP and mail, with [Mozilla's trusted roots](https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html) for systems that have none, are pinned in `deps.lock`, fetched by the build and built into `libmc.a`.
- **A platform layer** for the clock, threads, files, directories, processes, environment, signals, sockets, file watching, login services, the terminal, pseudo-terminals and system statistics.
- **JSON and YAML** parsing into one document tree, and JSON encoding back, with numbers read the same whatever locale the program set.

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| Language | C23 |
| Compilers | clang 18 or later (primary), gcc 14 or later |
| Platforms | macOS aarch64, Linux x86_64, Linux aarch64 |
| Cross builds | [zig](https://ziglang.org) 0.15.2, pinned in `mise.toml` |
| Profile | Modern C Level 2 |

Windows is not supported until `src/platform/` has a Windows implementation.

Cross builds of the macOS library need no macOS SDK: `src/platform/watch_darwin.c` declares the few FSEvents functions it calls, and where the SDK is present the compiler checks those declarations against its headers. `src/net/curl/macos/sdk/` does the same for the two SystemConfiguration calls curl makes; the build searches it after the SDK.

## Building

The build program is written in C and rebuilds itself when it changes. Bootstrap it once:

```sh
cc tools/build.c -o nob
```

Then:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `./nob` | Debug library with AddressSanitizer and UBSan: `out/debug/libmc.a` |
| `./nob release` | Optimised library: `out/release/libmc.a` |
| `./nob test` | Builds and runs the tests under the sanitizers |
| `./nob check` | Runs the `modern-c` contract checker, then the tests (see below) |
| `./nob cross` | Release library for every platform: `out/<platform>/release/libmc.a` |
| `./nob clean` | Removes `out/` |
| `./nob hash <dir>` | Prints the `deps.lock` hash of a directory |

The dependencies are not committed. Every build but `clean` checks `deps/<name>` against the hash in `deps.lock` and, when it is missing or differs, fetches it with `curl` from this repository's release `deps-<name>-<version>`, so the first build needs the network. To update one, put the new source in `deps/<name>`, trimmed to what the build compiles plus its license, update its line with the version, the new release URL and `./nob hash deps/<name>`, and publish it with `tools/publish-dep.sh`. `tools/cacert.sh` writes a newer extract of Mozilla's roots into `deps/cacert`.

Host builds use `$CC`, or `cc` when it is unset: `CC=gcc-14 ./nob test`. Each build records the compiler version and flags in `out/<build>/fingerprint` and recompiles everything when they change.

CI runs `./nob test` and `./nob release` with clang 18 and gcc 14 on Linux x86_64 and aarch64 and with clang on macOS aarch64, and `./nob cross` with the pinned zig; see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

`./nob check` needs Ruby and the `modern-c` checker at `~/.agents/tools/modern-c/modern-c`. Neither ships with this repository, so the check runs only where they are installed.

## Usage

Link `libmc.a` with `-lpthread -lm`, and on macOS `-framework CoreServices` for file watching and `-framework SystemConfiguration -framework CoreFoundation` for HTTP and mail, and add `include/` to the include path. To build it with your project, pin this repository as a dependency and run `./nob release` in it, which fetches libmc's own dependencies. Headers are included by area and module:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#include "mc/platform/platform.h"
#include "mc/text/str.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "usage: %s FILE\n", argv[0]);
        return 2;
    }
    Arena *arena = arena_create(0);
    Err err = { 0 };
    String contents;
    if (file_read_all(arena, S(argv[1]), &contents, &err) != ERR_OK) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", err.msg);
        arena_destroy(arena);
        return 1;
    }
    StringList lines = strlist_from_lines(arena, contents);
    printf("%zu lines\n", lines.count);
    if (lines.count > 0) {
        printf("first: %.*s\n", (int)lines.items[0].len, lines.items[0].data);
    }
    arena_destroy(arena);
    return 0;
}
```

```sh
cc -std=c23 -Iinclude main.c out/release/libmc.a -lpthread -lm -o example
```

### From other languages

The library exports plain C functions and fixed-layout structs, so any language that can link a static C library can call it. Examples include C++, Rust, Zig, Go (through cgo) and Swift. Keep the following in mind:

- **C++.** Include the headers inside an `extern "C" { ... }` block.
- **Structs passed by value.** `String` is `{ const char *data; size_t len; }` and is passed by value. `Err` is a 512-byte message buffer that the caller provides. `Mutex`, `Cond` and `Thread` are opaque, fixed-size storage. `Cancel` holds a C11 `atomic_bool`; treat it as opaque and touch it only through `cancel_*`.
- **Header-only helpers.** The definitions in `mc/core/base.h` (`countof`, `min_size`, `max_size` and the `NS_PER_*` constants) are macros and inline functions. They are not exported symbols.
- **Out of memory aborts.** When an arena cannot get memory from the system, the process aborts. No error is returned.
- **Arenas are single-threaded.** Give each thread its own arena.
- **Unprefixed names.** Symbols such as `S`, `str_*` and `file_*` have no library prefix and can clash with other C libraries in the same binary.
- **Vendored symbols.** `libmc.a` also contains yyjson's `yyjson_*`, cyaml's `cyaml_*` and utf8proc's `utf8proc_*` symbols. A project that uses yyjson directly includes `deps/yyjson/yyjson.h` from libmc instead of linking a second copy.
- **No ABI stability promise.** Rebuild the library together with the code that uses it.

## Conventions

- **Strings.** A `String` is a view and owns nothing. Functions that take an `Arena` return NUL-terminated strings allocated in it.
- **Memory.** Arena memory comes back zeroed. Use `arena_mark` and `arena_release` for temporary allocations. Only `src/core/arena.c` calls `malloc`, apart from cyaml, whose allocations stay inside `src/encoding/yaml.c`. `src/text/unicode.c` calls only the utf8proc functions that write into a buffer it passes, never the ones that allocate. yyjson allocates from a scratch arena that `json_parse` frees before it returns.
- **Errors.** A function that can fail for reasons outside the caller's control, such as I/O, the network or a child process, returns `Error` and is marked `[[nodiscard]]`. Results come back through out-parameters. The last parameter is an optional `Err *` that receives a human-readable message; pass `nullptr` to ignore it. Parsers and lookups, for which "no" is an ordinary answer, return `bool` instead. Running out of memory, an allocation size that overflows, or a failed mutex or condition variable call aborts.
- **Ownership is in the signature.** A function that allocates takes an `Arena *`. A function without one returns a view or nothing.
- **No global state.** The exceptions are `env_set`, which changes the process environment, and the C locale that `float_parse` and `float_format` create once and share. `process_run` blocks `SIGPIPE` only in the calling thread while it feeds the child, and discards any `SIGPIPE` that leaves pending.
- **Bundled libraries.** A dependency is bundled when it serves a capability that libmc exposes through its own types, and never on its own terms. yyjson and cyaml both feed one `Node` tree, so JSON and YAML stay in one library and a program pays for only the parser it calls: `libmc.a` is a static archive, each parser is its own translation unit, and the linker pulls in only what is referenced. Splitting the library would buy nothing.
- **Bridging stays in the project.** libmc is plain C with a plain C ABI and knows nothing about who calls it. It takes and returns its own types: `String`, `Arena *`, `Error`, `Err *`, fixed-layout structs and opaque handles. A project that uses it from Swift, C++, Rust, Zig, Go or Objective-C does the translation on its own side, in one bridging module: a Swift bridging header and a `String` to `Swift.String` layer, an `extern "C"` wrapper with RAII handles in C++, cgo conversions in Go. Nothing for that goes into libmc: no `#ifdef __cplusplus` or `extern "C"` blocks in its headers, the caller adds them; no Foundation, CoreFoundation, `NSString` or `CFString`; no framework headers; no callback shapes designed for one host language; no OS-specific API outside `src/platform/`. A libmc PR that exists only to make one language's bridge easier is declined. The bridge changes instead.
